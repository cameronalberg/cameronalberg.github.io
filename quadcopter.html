				these machines can perform inventory checks with no errors and speeds up to 400x faster than current methods.</p>

			  <p class="lead" style="font-style:italic">How can we increase quadcopter flight time without comprising structural integrity?</p>
				<p class="lead">The flight time of a quadcopter is primarily determined by its weight. Removing unnecessary material is the obvious solution, but even <b>single grams</b> of weight have a significant effect on performance.
				Structural components need to be designed with millimeter precision, so that the system can be as light as absolutely possible.</p>

				<h2 class="featurette-heading" style="margin-bottom:10px">Process</h2>
				<p class="lead">When redesigning the structural components, we started by planning the electronics placement to minimize the amount of parts necessary. Many of the parts I designed were 3D printed, and were stress tested with physical experimentation as well as finite-element simulations in Fusion 360. If parts were stronger than they needed to be, I would remove material until we acheived the lightest design that could still withstand impacts (including a safety factor). </p>
				<p class="lead">We tested the thrust and power consumption of propellers of varying sizes and pitches in combination with flight simulations to determine the propeller and battery size combination that would allow the longest flight time. I also worked extensively with the electronics team to determine the optimal design of the circuit boards, reducing the amount of wiring needed (and therefore weight).  
				</p>
				<p class="lead">When designing the cover we explored vacuum forming, along with FDM and SLA 3D printers using minimum printable thicknesses. I created the lightest design using a 3D printed (SLA) flexible resin, with added supports to provide rigidity. It is designed to be sleek and intimidating while also protecting the electronic components.

				<p class="lead">The flight time of the 4th generation quadcopter was increased by 80% compared to the previous model, and the overall size was reduced by 20%. The cover uses snap fits to attach to the quadcopter, allowing for easy removal when inner components need to be accessed.</p>
